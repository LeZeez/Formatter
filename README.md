## An ST all AI messages formatter.
It converts fairly ~any message~ (some messages) to:
- 1 paragraph
- bare text –› *narration/actions*
- “dialogue,” –› "dialogue."
- replaces commas at the end of dialogues with something based on the feelings of the message

---
### To make it work properly, Always make sure dialogues are in "quotes"

Plans:
I'm planning to make it more customizable, but for now i'm aiming for stability.
